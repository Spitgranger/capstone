\section{Introduction}

Hazards can be defined as either a state of the system or an action
taken on the system, which causes system failures. System failures
include, but are not limited to, an inability of the system to
perform its required functions, loss of data, unauthorized access,
or harm to users.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\wss{You should say what \textbf{loss} could be incurred because of the
hazards.}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\wss{Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards.
  You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel
  for the major
  ones.  For projects that involve hardware, the components will
  typically include
  each individual piece of hardware.  If your software will have a
  database, or an
important library, these are also potential components.}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
  minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.
  For instance,
  you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here. This is the most important part of
this document.}
\wss{The safety requirements in the table do not have to have the prefix SR.
  The most important thing is to show traceability to your SRS. You
  might trace to
  requirements you have already written, or you might need to add new
requirements.}
\wss{If no safety requirement can be devised, other mitigation strategies can be
  entered in the table, including strategies involving providing additional
documentation, and/or test cases.}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}
\begin{enumerate}[{SFR}1.]
  \item The system shall notify the facilities manager if a contractor declines
    to sign a document.\\
    \newline Rationale: The facilities manager should be aware if
    their contractor
    declines to sign a document. This creates a health and safety concern.\\
    \newline Fit criterion: The facilities manager receives a
    notification from the
    application identifying the contractor and the document.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the
  capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
  \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
  \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
